# Task-01-Iris-Flowers-Classification-ML-Project

This particular ML project is usually rederred to as the "Hello World" of Macine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes about sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The task is to predict whether it is of Setos or Versicolor or Virginica Species.

Since this is a small dataset, this can be easily done by some of the very popular classification ML algorithms.

### Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision tree, K - Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machines

All these are used directly from the sklearn module of python.
